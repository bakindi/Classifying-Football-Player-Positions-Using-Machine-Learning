# Classifying-Football-Player-Positions-Using-Machine-Learning
In football, young players in academies are often tried in multiple positions to explore their talents and determine the position where they can play with maximum efficiency. However, if a child or young football player experiences these situations too often, they may lose confidence and underperform before they discover their potential talents. In this study, in order to overcome this problem that is frequently encountered in football academies, I will use machine learning model to predict the position where the football player performs best. I also made a web application with streamlit for the project. You can find more detailed explanations about the project in my article on my medium account(https://medium.com/@battalbakindi/machine-learning-and-football-position-prediction-based-on-statistics-a52cb47c7799).
